## Exercise 2: Creating and Testing a Currency Converter Plugin with Semantic Kernel

In this exercise, you will create a currency converter plugin using
Semantic Kernel. You will write and test a function that converts an
amount from one currency to another using predefined exchange rates.
This exercise will help you understand how to build and invoke custom
plugins, utilize decorators for functionality and descriptions, and
integrate plugins into a larger application.

**Important:** You need to complete the Setup instructions in the previous unit, Prepare, before you begin this exercise.

1.  Create a new file named **CurrencyConverter.cs** in the **Stater/Plugins/ConvertCurrency** folder

    ![](./media/image12.png)


2.  In the **CurrencyConverter.cs** file, add the following code to create a plugin function:


```
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using System.ComponentModel;
using AITravelAgent;

class CurrencyConverter
{
    [KernelFunction, 
    Description("Convert an amount from one currency to another")]
    public static string ConvertAmount(
    {
        var currencyDictionary = Currency.Currencies;
    }
}
```


![](./media/image13.png)

In this code, you use the KernelFunction decorator to declare your native function. You also use the Description decorator to add a description of what the function does. You can use Currency.Currencies to get a dictionary of currencies and their exchange rates. Next, add some logic to convert a given amount from one currency to another.

3.  Modify your **ConvertAmount** function, the full code is looks like:


```
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using System.ComponentModel;
using AITravelAgent;

class CurrencyConverter
{
    [KernelFunction, Description(@"Converts an amount from one currency to another
        and returns a friendly message with the results")]
    public static string ConvertAmount(
        [Description("The starting currency code")] string baseCurrencyCode,
        [Description("The target currency code")] string targetCurrencyCode, 
        [Description("The amount to convert")] string amount)
    {
        var currencyDictionary = Currency.Currencies;
        Currency targetCurrency = currencyDictionary[targetCurrencyCode];
        Currency baseCurrency = currencyDictionary[baseCurrencyCode];
        
        if (targetCurrency == null)
        {
            return targetCurrencyCode + " was not found";
        }
        else if (baseCurrency == null)
        {
            return baseCurrencyCode + " was not found";
        }
        else
        {
            double amountInUSD = Double.Parse(amount) * baseCurrency.USDPerUnit;
            double result = amountInUSD * targetCurrency.UnitsPerUSD;
            return $"${amount} {baseCurrencyCode} is approximately {result.ToString("C")} in {targetCurrency.Name}s ({targetCurrencyCode})";
        }
    }
}
```


In this code, you use the Currency.Currencies dictionary to get the Currency object for the target and base currencies. You then use the Currency object to convert the amount from the base currency to the target currency. Finally, you return a string with the converted amount. Next, let's test your plugin.

![](./media/image14.png)


> **Note:** When using the Semantic Kernel SDK in your own projects, you don't need to hardcode data into files if you have access to RESTful APIs. Instead, you can use the Plugins.Core.HttpClient plugin to retrieve data from APIs.

4.  In the **Starter/Program.cs** file, import and invoke your new plugin function with the following code. (Delete the code below var kernel = builder.Build(); and replace it with the given below code. )


```
kernel.ImportPluginFromType<CurrencyConverter>();
kernel.ImportPluginFromType<ConversationSummaryPlugin>();
var prompts = kernel.ImportPluginFromPromptDirectory("Prompts");

var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync("CurrencyConverter", 
    "ConvertAmount", 
    new() {
        {"targetCurrencyCode", "USD"}, 
        {"amount", "52000"}, 
        {"baseCurrencyCode", "VND"}
    }
);

Console.WriteLine(result);
```


In this code, you use the ImportPluginFromType method to import your plugin. Then you use the InvokeAsync method to invoke your plugin function. The InvokeAsync method takes the plugin name, function name, and a dictionary of parameters. Finally, you print the result to the console. Next, run the code to make sure it's working.

![](./media/image15.png)


5.  Go to files from top bar and select **Save all.**

    ![](./media/image16.png)


6.  In the terminal, enter +++**dotnet run**+++. You should see the following output:

    Output: \$52000 VND is approximately \$2.13 in US Dollars (USD)

    ![](./media/image17.png)

Now that your plugin is working correctly, let's create a natural language prompt that can detect what currencies and amount the user wants to convert.

## Exercise 3: Configuring a Target Currency Prompt for Semantic Processing

In this exercise, you will configure a prompt system to identify target
currencies, base currencies, and amounts from user input. By creating
and setting up configuration and prompt files, you will define how the
AI interprets and processes natural language requests for currency
conversions.

1.  Open your project directory in Visual Studio Code or File Explorer and locate the **Starter/Prompt** folder. Navigate into this folder to prepare for the next steps.

    ![](./media/image18.png)


2.  Inside the **Starter/Prompt** folder, create a new folder named **GetTargetCurrencies**. This folder will contain all the files related to this exercise.

    ![](./media/image19.png)


3.  Within the **GetTargetCurrencies** folder, create a new file named **config.json**.

    ![](./media/image20.png)


4.  Open the newly created **config.json** file in Visual Studio Code. Copy and paste the following code into the file:


```
{
    "schema": 1,
    "type": "completion",
    "description": "Identify the target currency, base currency, and amount to convert",
    "execution_settings": {
        "default": {
            "max_tokens": 800,
            "temperature": 0
        }
    },
    "input_variables": [
        {
            "name": "input",
            "description": "Text describing some currency amount to convert",
            "required": true
        }
    ]
}
```


![](./media/image21.png)

Save the file by pressing Ctrl + S. This configuration defines how the AI system should interpret and process user input.

5.  Still inside the **GetTargetCurrencies** folder, create another new file named +++**skprompt.txt**+++.

    ![](./media/image22.png)


6.  Open the **skprompt.txt** file in your text editor and paste the following content:


```
<message role="system">Identify the target currency, base currency, and 
amount from the user's input in the format target|base|amount</message>

For example: 

<message role="user">How much in GBP is 750.000 VND?</message>
<message role="assistant">GBP|VND|750000</message>

<message role="user">How much is 60 USD in New Zealand Dollars?</message>
<message role="assistant">NZD|USD|60</message>

<message role="user">How many Korean Won is 33,000 yen?</message>
<message role="assistant">KRW|JPY|33000</message>

<message role="user">{{$input}}</message>
<message role="assistant">target|base|amount</message>
```



![](./media/image23.png)

Save the file by pressing **Ctrl + S**. This script defines the prompt logic for processing currency conversion requests.

## Exercise 4: Configuring a Prompt System for Travel Activity Recommendations

In this exercise, you will set up and customize a prompt system to
suggest activities and points of interest based on a user's travel
destination. By editing configuration and prompt files, you will define
the system's behavior, tone, and input requirements to generate
personalized and creative travel recommendations.

1.  Open your project directory in Visual Studio Code or File Explorer. Navigate to the folder **Starter/Prompts/SuggestActivities**.

    ![](./media/image24.png)


2.  Locate the **config.json** file inside the SuggestActivities folder and open it.

    ![](./media/image25.png)


3.  Replace the existing code in the **config.json** file with the following:


```
{
    "schema": 1,
    "type": "completion",
    "description": "Suggest activities and points of interest at a given destination",
    "execution_settings": {
        "default": {
            "max_tokens": 4000,
            "temperature": 0.5
        }
    },
    "input_variables": [
        {
            "name": "history",
            "description": "Some background information about the user",
            "required": false
        },
        {
            "name": "destination",
            "description": "The destination a user wants to visit",
            "required": true
        }
    ]
  }
```


![](./media/image26.png)

Save the file after making the changes by pressing Ctrl + S. This file configures the system to process user inputs and generate suggestions for activities.

4.  Stay within the SuggestActivities folder and locate the **skprompt.txt** file. Open this file in editor.

    ![](./media/image27.png)


5.  Replace the existing content of **skprompt.txt** with the following text:


```
You are an experienced travel agent. 
You are helpful, creative, and very friendly. 
Consider the traveler's background: {{$history}}
The traveler would like some activity recommendations for their trip to {{$destination}}.
Please suggest a list of things to do, see, and points of interest.
```


![](./media/image28.png)

Save the file by pressing **Ctrl + S**. This script sets the behaviour and tone of the system when generating activity recommendations.

## Exercise 5: Configuring the Main Program for AI Workflow

In this exercise, you will configure the main Program.cs file to
integrate with Azure OpenAI services and the Microsoft Semantic Kernel.
By customizing the code, you will enable functionalities such as
currency conversion, activity suggestions, and travel recommendations.
This setup establishes a robust AI-powered workflow for user interaction
and intent recognition, leveraging plugins and prompt-based logic.

1.  Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor. Navigate to the **Starter/Program.cs** file and open it for editing.

![](./media/image29.png)


2.  Replace the entire content of the **Program.cs** file with the following code and then **press cntrl + S** to save the code.

    > **Note:** After replacing code, please again add endpoint, Key and deployment name in the respected part of code.


```
using System.Text;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.OpenAI;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Plugins.Core;
#pragma warning disable SKEXP0050 
#pragma warning disable SKEXP0060

string yourDeploymentName = "gpt-35-turbo-16k";
string yourEndpoint = "EndPoint";
string yourApiKey = "API Key";

var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
builder.Services.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
    yourDeploymentName,
    yourEndpoint,
    yourApiKey,
    "gpt-35-turbo-16k");
var kernel = builder.Build();

kernel.ImportPluginFromType<CurrencyConverter>();
kernel.ImportPluginFromType<ConversationSummaryPlugin>();
var prompts = kernel.ImportPluginFromPromptDirectory("Prompts");

// Note: ChatHistory isn't working correctly as of SemanticKernel v 1.4.0
StringBuilder chatHistory = new();

OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings settings = new()
{
    ToolCallBehavior = ToolCallBehavior.AutoInvokeKernelFunctions
};

string input;

do {
    Console.WriteLine("What would you like to do?");
    input = Console.ReadLine()!;

    var intent = await kernel.InvokeAsync<string>(
        prompts["GetIntent"], 
        new() {{ "input",  input }}
    );

    switch (intent) {
        case "ConvertCurrency": 
            var currencyText = await kernel.InvokeAsync<string>(
                prompts["GetTargetCurrencies"], 
                new() {{ "input",  input }}
            );
            
            var currencyInfo = currencyText!.Split("|");
            var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync("CurrencyConverter", 
                "ConvertAmount", 
                new() {
                    {"targetCurrencyCode", currencyInfo[0]}, 
                    {"baseCurrencyCode", currencyInfo[1]},
                    {"amount", currencyInfo[2]}, 
                }
            );
            Console.WriteLine(result);
            break;
        case "SuggestDestinations":
            chatHistory.AppendLine("User:" + input);
            var recommendations = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(input!);
            Console.WriteLine(recommendations);
            break;
        case "SuggestActivities":

            var chatSummary = await kernel.InvokeAsync(
                "ConversationSummaryPlugin", 
                "SummarizeConversation", 
                new() {{ "input", chatHistory.ToString() }});

            var activities = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(
                input!,
                new () {
                    {"input", input},
                    {"history", chatSummary},
                    {"ToolCallBehavior", ToolCallBehavior.AutoInvokeKernelFunctions}
            });

            chatHistory.AppendLine("User:" + input);
            chatHistory.AppendLine("Assistant:" + activities.ToString());

            Console.WriteLine(activities);
            break;
        case "HelpfulPhrases":
        case "Translate":
            var autoInvokeResult = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(input, new(settings));
            Console.WriteLine(autoInvokeResult);
            break;
        default:
            Console.WriteLine("Sure, I can help with that.");
            var otherIntentResult = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(input);
            Console.WriteLine(otherIntentResult);
            break;
    }
} 
while (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input));
```


The program begins by importing essential namespaces such as System.Text for text handling and Microsoft.SemanticKernel for AI-powered conversational workflows. It integrates Microsoft Azure OpenAI services through the Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.OpenAI namespace, allowing communication with the GPT model (gpt-35-turbo-16k). The configuration involves setting up variables like yourDeploymentName, yourEndpoint, and yourApiKey to authenticate and connect to the Azure OpenAI endpoint.

The Semantic Kernel is initialized using a builder pattern. Plugins for additional functionalities, such as CurrencyConverter and ConversationSummaryPlugin, are imported. Furthermore, prompts stored in a directory (Prompts) are dynamically loaded to facilitate intent recognition and task execution.

The main loop of the program interacts with the user by asking for input and determining the intent using the GetIntent prompt. Based on the intent, the program branches into different functionalities:

1.	Currency Conversion: If the intent is to convert currency, the program extracts details (target currency, base currency, and amount) using the GetTargetCurrencies prompt. It then calls the CurrencyConverter plugin's ConvertAmount method and displays the result.

2.	Destination Suggestions: If the intent is to suggest destinations, the program uses the Semantic Kernel's InvokePromptAsync method to provide recommendations based on user input.

3.	Activity Suggestions: This functionality leverages conversation summarization through the ConversationSummaryPlugin to provide contextually relevant activity suggestions. The conversation history is maintained using a StringBuilder object for continuous dialogue flow.

4.	Helpful Phrases and Translation: For intents like "HelpfulPhrases" or "Translate," the kernel automatically invokes relevant functions based on the input and settings.

Other user intents are handled generically by invoking the prompt system, ensuring flexibility in responses. The interaction loop continues until the user provides no input (an empty string).

## Exercise 6: Testing the Application

In this exercise, you will test the functionality of your application by
running queries for currency conversion, destination suggestions, and
activity recommendations. This will ensure your AI-powered system is
working as intended and providing accurate, context-sensitive outputs.

**Steps to Test**

1.  **Run the Application**

    - Right-click on the Starter folder and select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

    - In the terminal, enter the following command to execute the application

    - +++dotnet run+++

2.  **Test Currency Conversion**

    - When prompted, enter a currency conversion query, such as: +++**How much is 60 USD in New Zealand dollars?**+++

    - Expected Output: **\$60 USD is approximately \$97.88 in New Zealand Dollars (NZD).**

3.  **Test Destination Suggestions**

    - Enter a query for destination suggestions, providing context. For
      example:  
      
      +++I'm planning an anniversary trip with my spouse, but they are currently using a wheelchair and accessibility is a must. What are some destinations that would be romantic for us?+++

    - Expected Output: A list of accessible romantic destinations, such
      as:

      1.  Santorini, Greece: Romantic sunsets and wheelchair-accessible
          paths in certain areas.

      2.  Venice, Italy: Gondola rides with accessible boarding options.

      3.  Maui, Hawaii: Stunning views and accessible resorts.

4.  **Test Activity Suggestions**

    - Enter a query for activity recommendations in a specific
      destination. For example:  
      
      +++What are some things to do in Barcelona?+++

    - Expected Output: Recommendations tailored to the destination, such
      as:

      1.  Visit the Sagrada Família: A Gaudí masterpiece with accessible
          facilities.

      2.  Explore Park Güell: Unique mosaic designs with
          wheelchair-friendly routes.

      3.  Discover the Picasso Museum: A wheelchair-accessible art
          venue.
